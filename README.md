## 📂 Data Wrangling

- Cleaned and transformed raw property data.
- Addressed missing values, outliers, and inconsistent formats.
- Engineered categorical and numerical fields for modeling.

---

## 🧱 Feature Engineering

- Derived features like area price averages, location tags, and amenity scores.
- Encoded categorical features using target encoding and one-hot encoding.
- Created interaction features to enhance model learning.

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Uncovered patterns in pricing vs. location, area type, furnishing, and number of bedrooms.
- Identified multicollinearity and visualized feature importance.
- Used seaborn, matplotlib, and Plotly for deep insight generation.

## 🧮 Predictive Pricing Module

**Goal**: Enable accurate price estimation to minimize valuation gaps.

- Trained on engineered dataset with historical price and feature inputs.
- Reduced MAE from **₹94L** to **₹25L** using Random Forest.
- Started with SVR as the baseline (₹62L MAE), outperforming models like Lasso, Linear Regression, Decision Tree, AdaBoost, and XGBoost.
- Supports informed pricing decisions for users.

## 🧠 Personalized Recommendation Engine

**Goal**: Increase buyer engagement through tailored property suggestions.

- Leverages spatial clustering and user preferences.
- Computes property similarity based on:
  - Location proximity
  - Feature match (e.g., size, type, layout)
- Surfaces high-relevance listings to improve discoverability.
